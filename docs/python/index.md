# Python Tricks You Should Know

by [Cameron Kleiman](https://camk.co), Spring 2023

This document is intended as an unofficial guide for MIT
[6.101](https://py.mit.edu/) (formerly 6.009) students to give you some handy
Python functions and tricks as you go about your 6.101 labs. The hints here will
help make your life easier as you go about developing your solutions to the
labs.

They won't help you with the labs directly, but they'll improve your Python
developer experience to help you write better, more efficient code that you can
understand. Without further ado, here's **Python Tricks You Should Know**.

## What's Included

This guide contains a few sections on different topics that will be more or less
relevant in 6.101, but also in your software projects in the future. Here's an
overview of this guide:

1. [General Advice] - General advice for beginners of programming on writing and
   debugging code.
2. [Useful Functions] - A wide variety of functions that will come in handy in
   6.101
3. [Editing Python] - Python-specific code style and editing tips
4. [Comprehensions] - An overview of Python's powerful comprehension feature
5. [Avoid This] - Some common pitfalls to avoid or watch out for as you write
   Python for 6.101

The [Useful Functions] and [Comprehensions] sections are more code-heavy, while
the [General Advice] and [Editing Python] sections contain more advice.

You're welcome to skip around and read the parts that interest you or read it
top-to-bottom, whatever you like. Some of these sections might be more useful
after you've done a few labs in 6.101, so feel free to skim and check back later
once you've made some more progress.

## Python Standard Library

Many parts of this guide contain links to the [Python Standard Library]
reference. This reference contains the authoritative documentation on the
built-in functions and data types that you'll use in 6.101. I highly recommend
using this resource if you want to learn more about them from the official
manual.
