by [Cameron Kleiman](https://camk.co), Spring 2023

This document is intended as an unofficial guide for MIT
[6.101](https://py.mit.edu/) (formerly 6.009) students to give you some handy
Python functions and tricks as you go about your 6.101 labs. The hints here will
help make your life easier as you go about developing your solutions to the
labs.

They won't help you with the labs directly, but they'll improve your Python
developer experience to help you write better, more efficient code that you can
understand. Without further ado, here's **Python Tricks You Should Know**.
